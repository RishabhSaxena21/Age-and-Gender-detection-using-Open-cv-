# Age-and-Gender-detection-using-Open-cv-
Age and gender detection using OpenCV is a computer vision task that involves predicting the age group and gender of a person from an image or video stream. OpenCV itself is a powerful library for image processing and computer vision, but it does not provide built-in models for age and gender detection.
